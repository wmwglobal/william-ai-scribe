## What Needs Work

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas Requiring Attention

**1. Podcast Mode (70% Complete)**
- Advanced conversational dynamics are implemented but need final integration
- Demo script system and behavioral anchoring are sophisticated but experimental
- *Impact:* This is our most ambitious feature but isn't yet seamlessly integrated

**2. Test Coverage (30% of Codebase)**
- Critical paths well-tested (lead scoring, core components)
- Many newer features lack comprehensive test coverage
- *Impact:* Development velocity is good, but we need broader testing for confidence

**3. Documentation Lag**
- Code quality is high, but documentation hasn't kept pace with feature development
- Some advanced features are ahead of user documentation
- *Impact:* Onboarding new team members takes longer

**4. Operational Readiness**
- Multiple API keys need secure environment management
- No automated CI/CD pipeline yet
- Missing production monitoring and alerting
- *Impact:* Manual deployment process, reactive issue resolution
