## Development Approach

Continue using the **spec-driven development** methodology established in this project:

1. Create detailed specifications for each new feature
2. Break down into manageable tasks using the spec manager
3. Implement with test-first approach
4. Validate against acceptance criteria
5. Update documentation and move to completed status

This approach has proven successful with the completion of the first three major tasks and establishment of a robust testing foundation.
