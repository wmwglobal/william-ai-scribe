## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| AI generates incorrect code | High | Medium | Comprehensive validation, human review |
| Specification ambiguity | High | Medium | Iterative refinement, examples |
| Test suite becomes slow | Medium | Low | Parallel execution, selective testing |
| Breaking changes | High | Low | Backward compatibility checks |

### Process Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Team resistance | High | Low | Training, gradual adoption |
| Specification maintenance overhead | Medium | Medium | Automation tools, templates |
| AI agent limitations | Medium | High | Human fallback, task categorization |

## Resource Requirements

### Human Resources
- **Lead Developer**: 20% time for oversight
- **AI Integration**: Use existing AI tools (Claude, Copilot)
