## Validation Scenarios

### Happy Path
1. User clicks microphone
2. Grants permission
3. Speaks clearly
4. Receives AI response
5. Can interrupt and speak again
6. Session completes successfully

### Permission Denied
1. User clicks microphone
2. Denies permission
3. Sees appropriate error message
4. Has option to retry
5. Instructions for enabling provided

### Network Failure
1. User speaking normally
2. Network disconnects
3. Error message appears
4. Queued audio preserved
5. Automatic retry on reconnection
6. Session continues

### High Latency
1. User speaks
2. Processing takes longer
3. Loading indicator shows
4. User can still interrupt
5. Response eventually arrives
6. No duplicate processing

### Browser Incompatible
1. User on unsupported browser
2. Feature detection runs
3. Fallback UI displayed
4. Alternative suggested
5. Graceful degradation
