# Task Management

## Task States
- **Backlog**: Tasks ready for implementation but not started
- **In Progress**: Currently being worked on (limit 1-2 concurrent)
- **Completed**: Finished and validated tasks

## Task Prioritization

### P0 - Critical (Must Do Now)

- Security vulnerabilities
- Data loss issues

### P1 - High (This Sprint)
- Core functionality improvements
- High-value features
- Performance issues affecting users

### P2 - Medium (Next Sprint)
- Nice-to-have features
- UI/UX improvements
- Technical debt reduction

### P3 - Low (Backlog)
- Future enhancements
- Experimental features
- Long-term improvements

## Current Sprint Focus
**Sprint Goal**: Establish testing infrastructure and improve code quality

### Active Tasks
1. [TASK-001] Set up testing framework
2. [TASK-002] Add unit tests for lead scoring
3. [TASK-003] Implement error boundaries

### Sprint Metrics
